# üåê Meshtastic IoT Alert System

An off-grid, decentralized environmental monitoring system using ESP32, LoRa, and Meshtastic. Designed to work in remote or disaster-prone areas without internet or cellular coverage. This project integrates IoT sensors with a LoRa-based mesh network for real-time environmental data and alert transmission.
